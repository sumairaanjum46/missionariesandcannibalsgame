# missionariesandcannibalsgame
The Missionaries and Cannibals game is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and game theory. The objective is to get all missionaries and cannibals across a river without ever allowing the cannibals to outnumber the missionaries on either side.

Game Rules
There are three missionaries and three cannibals on one side of the river.
A boat can carry a maximum of two people.
At no point should the number of cannibals exceed the number of missionaries on either side of the river. If they do, the cannibals will eat the missionaries.
The goal is to transport all missionaries and cannibals to the other side of the river safely.
